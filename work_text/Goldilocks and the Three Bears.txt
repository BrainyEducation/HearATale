How would you feel if someone came into your house like Goldilocks and ate your food and broke your things? What do you think happened to Goldilocks after she ran away? Draw a picture or tell or write a letter from the baby bear to Goldilocks’ mother. Draw or tell or write what Goldilocks did in the beginning, the middle, and the end.</p>
