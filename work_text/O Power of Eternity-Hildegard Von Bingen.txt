<i>On The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>
Hail, Mary, architect of life! 
You who rebuilt salvation, 
You who destroyed death, 
And trampled the serpent
To whom Eve arose
With outstretched  throat, blown up in her pride.
You crushed him underfoot
When you gave birth to the Son of God from heaven, 
Who was breathed into you by the Holy Spirit.

O sweetest and most loving Mother, hail!
You have given forth into this world your heaven-sent
Son
Who was breathed into you by the Holy Spirit.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy
Spirit
Who breathed Him into you.

<i>De Sancta Maria</i>
Ave, Maria, o auctrix vitae,
reaedificando salutem,
quae mortem conturbasti 
et serpentem contrivisti,
ad quem se Eva erexit
erecta cervice cum sufflatu superbiae. 
Rune conculcasti,
dum de caelo Filium Dei genuisti,
quem inspiravit Spiritus Dei.

O dulcissima atque amantissima Mater, salve,
quae Natum tuum de caelo missum mundo edidisti. 
Quem inspiravit Spiritus Dei.

Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto. 

Quem inspiravit Spiritus Dei.
