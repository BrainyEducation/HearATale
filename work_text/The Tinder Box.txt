<p>Name some of the magic things the tinder box did.  What would you do if you had a magic box that would give you whatever you ask for? What would you ask for? Decorate a box—maybe a cereal box or a shoe box—and put in it pictures you cut out or draw or small toys or models of things you would ask for.   </p>

<p>Many characters in the story follow instructions, for example, the dogs, the prince, the soldier, or the princess.  Pick one of the characters and tell about the instructions that the character had to follow so that the fairy tale will end “happily ever after.”   Think of something that you like to do—something like play jacks, throw a frisbee, catch a grasshopper, make toast, draw a picture of a car, whistle, or something like that.  Give clear, good instructions so that another student can do that activity correctly.  </p>
