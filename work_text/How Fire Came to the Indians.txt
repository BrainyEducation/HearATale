<p>In the beginning, did the Indians have fire? What were the black bags of water in the sky? What were the crooked sticks of light? Did the people like to eat their food raw? Why was it raw? Why were the children shivering? When the boy told the men and women that he would bring them fire, they laughed. When the Great Spirit took the black bags away, how did the boy prepare himself? When he shot the arrow into the bag, what came down to the earth? Were the people happy? What were the colors of the fire, and where did they come from? When it was all over, the people missed the boy. What happened to him? Tell an adult about the story.</p>
