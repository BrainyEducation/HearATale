<i>On the Blessed Virgin Mary</i>
0 greenest blooming branch, hail!
You who in the gusting wind of the saints' quest for knowledge
Came forth.

When the time was ripe,
When the flowers bloomed in your branches, 
Hail, hail to you,
For the heat of the sun was distilled in you, 
Like the aroma of Balsam.

For in you the lovely flower blossomed, 
And gave its aroma to all the herbs 
Which had dried out,
And they all appeared in the fullness of green.

Because of you the heavens dropped dew upon the grass,
And the whole earth was made joyful, 
Because her womb brought forth wheat,
And because the birds of heaven found their nests on her.



Then was made food for men,
And great rejoicing among the banqueters.

And so, o sweet Virgin,
In you no joy is ever lacking. 
All these things Eve despised.
But now, praise be to the Almighty!

<i>De Sancta Maria</i>
O viridissima virga, ave,
quae in ventoso flabro sciscitationis sanctorum prodisti.



Cum venit tempus,
quod tu floruisti in ramis tuis, 
ave, ave sit tibi,
quia calor solis in te sudavit s
icut odor balsami.

Nam in te floruit pulcher jlos,
qui odorem dedit omnibus aromatibus, 
quae arida erant.
Et ilia apparuerunt omnia in viriditate plena.
Unde caeli dederunt rorem super gramen,
et omnis terra laetafacta est,
quoniam viscera ipsius frumentum protulerunt,
et quoniam volucres caeli nidos in ipsa habuerunt.



Deindefacta  est esca hominibus 
et gaudium magnum epulantium.

Unde, o suavis Virgo,
in te non deficit ullum gaudium. 
Haec omnia Eva contempsit. 
Nunc autem taus sit Altissimo.
