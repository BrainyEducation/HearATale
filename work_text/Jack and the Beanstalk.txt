<p>Draw and cut out a picture of Jack and a picture of the giant—or with some play dough or clay make a Jack and a giant.  With a piece of string or a stick make a beanstalk.   Find a chair or table you can use to be the land above the clouds.  Using these retell the story and show what happened.  </p>
