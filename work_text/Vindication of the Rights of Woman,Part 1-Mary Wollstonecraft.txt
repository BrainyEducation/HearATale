<h4>Introduction</h4>
After considering the historic page, and viewing the living world with anxious solicitude, the most melancholy emotions of sorrowful indignation have depressed my spirits, and I have sighed when obliged to confess, that either nature has made a great difference between man and man, or that the civilization which has hitherto taken place in the world has been very partial.  I have  turned  over  various  books  written  on  the subject of education,  and patiently observed  the conduct of parents  and the management of schools;  but what has been the  result?--a  profound  conviction  that  the neglected education  of my fellow-creatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore; and that women, in particular, are rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes, originating from one hasty conclusion.  The conduct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove that their minds are not in a healthy state; for, like the flowers which are planted in too rich a soil, strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty; and the flaunting leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived at maturity. -- One cause of this barren  blooming I attribute  to a false system  of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering  females  rather as women than human creatures, have  been more anxious  to make them alluring  mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so bubbled by this specious homage, that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition,  and by their abilities and virtues exact  respect.
In a treatise,  therefore,  on female  rights and manners, the works which have been particularly written for their improvement must not be overlooked;  especially  when it is asserted,   in  direct   terms,  that  the  minds  of  women  are enfeebled  by false refinement;  that the books of instruction, written by men of genius, have had the same tendency as more frivolous productions;  and that, in the true style of Mahometanism, they are treated as a kind of subordinate beings (1), and  not  as  a  part  of  the  human  species,   when improvable reason is allowed to be the dignified distinction which raises men above the brute creation, and puts a natural sceptre in a feeble hand.
Yet, because I am a woman, I would not lead my readers to suppose that I mean violently to agitate the contested question respecting the equality or inferiority of the sex; but as the subject lies in my way, and I cannot pass it over without subjecting the main tendency of my reasoning to misconstruction, I shall stop a moment to deliver, in a few words, my opinion. -- In the government of the physical world it is observable that the female in point of strength is, in general, inferior to the male. This is the law of nature; and it does not appear to be suspended or abrogated in favour of women. A degree of physical superiority cannot, therefore, be denied -- and it is a noble prerogative! But not content with this natural pre-eminence, men endeavour to sink us still lower, merely to render us alluring objects for a moment; and women, intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses, pay them, do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts, or to become the friends of the fellow creatures who find amusement in their society.
I am aware of an obvious inference: -- from every quarter have I heard exclamations against masculine women; but where are they to be found? If by this appellation  men mean to  inveigh  against  their ardour in hunting, shooting,  and gaming,  I shall  most cordially  join in the cry;  but if it be against  the imitation of manly virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of those talents and virtues, the exercise of which ennobles  the human character,  and which raise females in the scale of animal being, when they are comprehensively termed man kind; -- all those who view them with a philosophic eye must, I should  think, wish with me, that they may every day grow more and more masculine.
