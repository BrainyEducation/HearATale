OF all the woodland flowers of earlier spring, 
These golden jasmines, each an air-hung bower. 
Meet for the Queen of Fairies' tiring hour, 
Seem loveliest and most fair in blossoming; 
How yonder mock-bird thrills his fervid wing 
And long, lithe throat, where twinkling flower on flower 
Rains the globed dewdrops down, a diamond shower, 
O'er his brown head poised as in act to sing; 
Lo! the swift sunshine floods the flowery urns, 
Girding their delicate gold with matchless light, 
Till the blent life of bough, leaf, blossom, burns; 
Then, then outbursts the mock-bird clear and loud, 
Half-drunk with perfume, veiled by radiance bright, 
A star of music in a fiery cloud!
