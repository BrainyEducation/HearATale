<p>How many blind men were in the story? If you were there, how could you help the blind men figure out what they were touching? Have you ever closed your eyes and tried to guess what something was just by touching it? Would it be easy or hard if the thing you felt was bigger than your hand?</p>

<p>Get some toys or simple things in your home that wonâ€™t break or cut or spill. Put these things in some kind of a box or sack. Close your eyes and keep them closed while you pick up each object and feel it. Can you tell what each object is by feeling it? (4-2, continued) What is it about feeling an object that can help you know? Draw a picture of something that feels like what you touched but is different. </p>
