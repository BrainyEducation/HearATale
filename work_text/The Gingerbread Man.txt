<p>Draw a picture of the Gingerbread Man and use glue or tape to put the picture on a stick or pencil. Listen to the story again, and when you hear the words—“Run, Run fast as you can, you can’t catch me I’m the Gingerbread Man!” — say them at the same time and make your Gingerbread Man hop and bounce and move along quickly.</p>

<p>That Gingerbread Man was really fast! Why do you think the Gingerbread Man ran and ran? Who did he run away from first? Who was the last character to chase him? What would you do to catch the Gingerbread man? Imagine a Gingerbread Man trap and, if you can, draw a picture of the trap.</p>
