<p>The lion did not believe the mouse would be able to help him. Did the lion make a mistake about that? Even the smallest friends can do big favors. Have you ever felt too small to help someone? Cut out a piece of paper and draw or write about a favor that you have done for someone else. Or, you can draw or write about a favor someone did for you. Make a “favor chain” by taping or hooking the papers together in a chain. Hang up the “favor chain” and add a paper link each time you do a favor or someone does a favor for you.</p>
