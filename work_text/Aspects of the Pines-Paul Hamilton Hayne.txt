TALL, sombre, grim, against the morning sky 
They rise, scarce touched by melancholy airs, 
Which stir the fadeless foliage dreamfully, 
As if from realms of mystical despairs.

Tall, sombre, grim, they stand with dusky gleams 
Brightening to gold within the woodland's core, 
Beneath the gracious noontide's tranquil beams-- 
But the weird winds of morning sigh no more.

A stillness, strange, divine, ineffable, 
Broods round and o'er them in the wind's surcease, 
And on each tinted copse and shimmering dell 
Rests the mute rapture of deep hearted peace.
Last, sunset comes--the solemn joy and might 
Borne from the West when cloudless day declines-- 
Low, flutelike breezes sweep the waves of light, 
And lifting dark green tresses of the pines,

Till every lock is luminous--gently float, 
Fraught with hale odors up the heavens afar 
To faint when twilight on her virginal throat 
Wears for a gem the tremulous vesper star.
