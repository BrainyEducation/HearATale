<p>What lesson did the Oak Tree learn from the reed?  Think of a lesson you learned from a friend.   What was the lesson you learned?  Was the lesson you learned a little bit like the lesson the oak tree learned or was the lesson you learned mostly different?</p>

<p>A person could say the moral, or lesson, of the story is that sometimes it is better not to be stubborn and end up breaking like the oak tree. Sometimes it’s better to be flexible and compromise and be willing to bend and change.  Have you ever been stubborn like the oak tree? Have you ever “bent” or been flexible and compromised like the reeds? Talk about it to your parent or a friend. </p>
