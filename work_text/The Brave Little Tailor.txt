<p>A tailor is someone who makes clothes for men to wear. When the little tailor said he got seven with one stroke what did he mean? Do you think that the other characters in the story would think he was brave if they knew what he had really gotten with one stroke? Did the tailor succeed because he was strong or handsome or rich or because he was clever and tricky and smart? What did the tailor do that was clever and tricky and smart?     </p>
