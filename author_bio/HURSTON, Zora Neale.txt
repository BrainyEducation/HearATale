Zora Neale Hurston (January 7, 1891—January 28, 1960)  is noted for her metaphorical language, her story-telling, and her interest in and celebration of Southern African-American culture.
Hurston grew up in Eatonville, Florida, the first incorporated black town in the U.S.  After the death of her mother (1904) her family life became increasingly difficult.  At age 16 she joined a traveling theatrical company, ending up in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance where she was to become a central figure.
Hurston attended Howard University from 1921 to 1924 and in 1925 won a scholarship to Barnard College where she studied anthropology under Franz Boas.  She graduated from Bernard in 1928 and for two years pursued graduate studies in anthropology at Columbia University.  Hurston also conducted field studies in folklore among African-Americans in the South.
In 1934 Zora Neale Hurston published her first novel, Johah’s Gourd Vine.  In 1935 she published Mules and Men, a study of folkways among African-Americans in Florida.  Her best-known work, the novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, appeared in 1937.  Her book, Tell My Horse, (1938) is a blend of travel writing and anthropology based on her investigations of voodoo in Haiti.  Her novel, Moses, Man of the Mountain, followed in 1939.
Hurston’s autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, was published in 1942, and her last book, Seraph on the Suwanee, a novel, appeared in 1948.
Zora Neale Hurston was out of print and nearly forgotten until a resurgence of interest in the 1970’s when a new generation of African-American writers, most notably Alice Walker, rediscovered and republished many of her writings.  In 1995, the Library of America published a two-volume set of her work, and a United States postage stamp commemorating Zora Neale Hurston was issued in 2003.
