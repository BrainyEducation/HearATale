O. Henry [William Sydney Porter](September 11, 1862—June 5, 1910) was a prolific short story writer  with a dry, humorous style who often used coincidence to achieve his famous surprise endings.
Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, he attended school for a short time, then clerked in an uncle’s drugstore.  At age 20, he went to Texas, working first on a ranch and later as a bank teller.  He began to write freelance sketches in 1877.  He founded his own humorous weekly, the Rolling Stone.  When this failed, he became a reporter and columnist for the Houston Post.
Indicted for embezzling bank funds (actually the result of technical mismanagement), he fled to a reporting job in New Orleans in 1896, then to Honduras.  When he returned, he was imprisoned in Columbus, Ohio for three years.  During this time, he wrote adventure stories set in Texas and Central America that quickly became popular.  Released from prison in 1902, he went to New York City and released his first collection of stories, Cabbages and Kings (1904).
O. Henry wrote prodigiously, publishing at least one story a week for a number of years.  His story collections include: The Four Million (1906), Heart of the West (1907), The Gentle Grafter (1908), The Voice of the City (1908), Options (1909), Whirligigs (1910) and Strictly Business (1910).
In his most famous story, “The Gift of the Magi,” a poverty-stricken New York couple secretly sell valued possessions to buy each other Christmas gifts.  Ironically, the wife sells her hair to buy her husband a watch chain, while he sells his watch to buy her a pair of combs for her hair.
Even after O. Henry’s death, six more collections of his stories appeared between 1911 and 1939.  The O. Henry Prize, awarded annually for the best American short story, is named in his honor.
